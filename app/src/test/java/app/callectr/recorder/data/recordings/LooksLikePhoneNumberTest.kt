/**
 * The gate that decides whether a baked "contact name" is really a phone number.
 *
 * It exists so a contact-only file-name template can still resolve names at display time: when no
 * contact was saved at record time, the formatter writes the NUMBER into the contact slot, and the
 * list has no parsed number to look up from. Reading that slot as a number — but only when it clearly
 * is one — lets a contact saved later show its name without re-recording (alex_812 (b)).
 *
 * The cost of a false positive is sending a real name to PhoneLookup, so the test leans on names
 * never being mistaken for numbers.
